# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# MyTime (Archived)

This is the original MyTime platform â€” a solo healing tool built during a time of personal reclamation.

Version: `v1.0`

ðŸ’Œ This code became the foundation for **Loop** â€” a trauma-informed collaborative care platform for patients and providers. Loop begins where MyTime left off: at the edge of healing, moving toward shared trust.

ðŸ‘‰ Visit [Loop Repo](https://github.com/your-username/loop-app) to follow its evolution.
